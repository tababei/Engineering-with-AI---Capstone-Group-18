# Validation of first Could requirement
This experiment entails walking in a rectangular patter multiple times, both clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CC). Upon completion of this experiment it can be seen that the first 2 times are somewhat close to one another, however the trajectory predicted on the third trip begins to diverge quite far away from the original. This can be attributed to equipment which is not sophisticated enough to capture the fineness of the movements. 

One interesting observation is that the model can work to some extent even outside
