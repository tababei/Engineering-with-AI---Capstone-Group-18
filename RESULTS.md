# Results commentary
Alongside the shell files that contain the code that gets the results, we have also uploaded some of the results themselves under the generic name "view-ID-NE.png". The ID represents a certain dataset to enable ease of identification and N represents the number of epochs of the trained model. 

## Comparison
Looking at "view-1008221029329889-10E.png" and at "view-1008221029329889-100E.png" the starkest comparison is in the RMSE and RPE. Both have a lower error by about 10%. This "diminishing returns" effect is expected due to our limited data which can make up for our limited dataset with an ever increasing amount of Epochs.
