# Validation of the Should requirement
## Should critically analyze and demonstrate what features were learned (human step detection, etc.) by the TLIO model .

For this experiment we determined a straight line to be the course. The course is once taken on foot, the model's prediction being saved in "view-walking.png". Once more, the course is taken but this time on a wheelchair that is pushed from behind and this time the results are saved in "view-walking.png". The contrast is stark and obvious when comparing the two images. The absence of perturbations on the Y-axis in the rolling results clearly shows that "steps", spikes in dy graph, are associated with forward movement by the model.
