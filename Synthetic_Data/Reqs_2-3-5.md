## Validation of second Must requirement
We were able to simulate running data with the help of "Synthetic data running.py". We consider the Y-axis to align with the gravity vector, thus the XZ-plane is host to the horizontal movement plane. 
Along the Y-axis we have a bobbing motion and in the ZX-plane a constant acceleration that only acts along one of the axes. 

## Validation of third Must (and first Could) requirement 
To validate this requirement we have recorded while standing still and also create a new file that should simulate this (constant acceleration only along Y-axis). The results can be observed in the "view-still_SYNTH" and "view-still_exp" files. The model performs considerably worse on our simulated data. One explanation for this is that we cannot replicate genuine organic movement specific to a human.
