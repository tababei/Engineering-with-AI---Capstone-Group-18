# Engineering-with-AI---Capstone-Group-18
This is a repository containing the process, code that we have used, and results we have obtained for our Capstone project in the Engineering with AI minor.

We have used the Delft Blue supercomputer to help facilitate rapid training, testing of the model, as well as running the Extended Karman Filter (EKF) and generating the final plots.
