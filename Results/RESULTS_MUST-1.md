# Results commentary
Alongside the shell files that contain the code that gets the results, we have also uploaded some of the results themselves under the generic name "view-ID-NE.png". The ID represents a certain dataset to enable ease of identification and N represents the number of epochs of the trained model. 

# Validating completion of the first "Must"
The results located in this directory confirm the completion of the first "Must". They align with our approach in the Project Plan as they closely resemble the findings illustrated in the paper.
